Many month ago I worked to a project where we think to implement a SSL Tcp Socket. The idea was finally abandonned due to other priorities. But I kept en mind this idea and I'm going to implement it now. To do that I will use Qt and its TCP stack. I will present all the needed steps to go from a simply TCP connection to an SSL connection between two application.

Many month ago I worked to a project where we think to implement a SSL Tcp Socket. The idea was finally abandonned due to other priorities. But I kept en mind this idea and I'm going to implement it now. To do that I will use Qt and its TCP stack. I will present all the needed steps to go from a simply TCP connection to an SSL connection between two application. 

# QT Network 

Qt provides a specific module to implement networking communication : [Qt Network](https://doc.qt.io/qt-6/qtnetwork-programming.html). To begin with our project, we need to understand how to implement a simple TCP connection. 
To do that we will need to application : 
1. One will be playing the role of server. It will open a connnection, listening for incomming connection
2. The other one will be playing the role of client. It will try to connect to the server

## QT TCP Socket Server

## QT TCP Client


# SSL Socket
